# This is an in-place, stable, worst-case n*log(n) sorting algorithm with O(1) additional memory complexity.
# Unlike blocksort, it is simple, and takes less than 100 lines of code.
# Unlike quicksort, its worst-case time is n*log(n).
# Unlike mergesort, it only needs a constant amount of auxiliary storage.
# Unlike heapsort, it is stable.

# overview: we keep a binary tree with the heap property, where each left subtree is full and the tree is stored
# in the array in depth-first order. We run k from 1 to n-1 and use the heap property to select the k'th-smallest 
# item in O(log(n)) time.

# some non-asymptotic speed-ups are possible.
